This is our ISBI conference paper

We are sorry for the delay as we need to sort this paper code from other codes. At this point, we can only release the training file and data prep files. It is worth noting that we do not have the right to release the ground truth as it involves many collaborators. However, the HCP data used in our study can be downloaded from this address: https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult.
